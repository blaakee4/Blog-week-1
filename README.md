# Blog-week-1
The readings this week brought to light something I hadn’t thought much about which was the effects and power technology has on a society. The first reading about telegraphs by J Carey talked about the changes the simple telegraph made to society forever. Instead of people having to physically travel to pass news to someone else far away they could now send it through the telegraph without having to move to the person. This wasn’t just a luxury used by people who didn’t feel like taking messages to others but also in things like war. Messages could be sent quick and easy to give a side an advantage of quick communication over their enemy. The first article pointed out the massive changes the telegraph brought to the world. Tim Wu then tries to illustrate how the internet can change society but mostly how easily it can be controlled by a government. When one talks about the internet the first thing that comes up usually is computers, and how they are the hub that allows everybody, even the unprofessional to access all sorts of information in seconds. Some believe computers are not educational or as effective as the classic classroom but others believe they will. Since this was written computers have developed so much more and are a part of most all schools and some people get their education completely from their computer. The article then goes on to talk about on page 322 how the simpler the device is the more the human mind is prone to remember how to work it and therefore it will be more successful. For me, I gravitate towards the more simple product when it comes to electronics. People have come up to me with facts as to why the Android is technically a better phone than the Iphone, but I know that the Iphone is simple and easy to work so I stick with it. You could make the assumption that this is why apple does better than most all other electronic companies they compete with across all their products because it is simple and easy to use. Obviously simplicity is only one of the many reasons why Apple dominates their competitors but it is an important one. People like simple because they are already dealing with problems of their own and don’t want an extra one with their computer.
