# Blog Week 4
The readings assigned during the fourth week of Information Studies were the most interesting to me personally of all of them so far. To start, the New York Times artic;e about cell phone tracking caught my attention quickly. I already knew that our phones knew where we were and that there were certain apps that could track our location, but I had no idea people had access to this information outside of the computers. I don’t want to say this is scary or disturbing, but it is a weird thought that somebody sees my daily routine and can sell it without my consent. On the other side however there are people who do take this very seriously like Edward Snowden, who is an employee of the NSA (National Security Agency). As an employee, he was able to give secrets about the company that people are calling a reveal that could go down in history as one of the biggest in United States politics. Edward Snowden fled the country to Hong Kong where apparently is the only place he can get away from US surveillance. As previously stated, I do not think this issue is worth leaving the country for, and probably wouldn’t even call it an issue. The video featuring Shoshana Zuboff brought up the point that there is an excessive amount of private information that goes into a surplus that doesn’t do anything for improving the services of the app or mobile device. I noticed that the more I read and heard about this issue I have to admit that I started to take it a lot more seriously. At the same token, there really isn’t a way to regulate how much information about the user’s daily life is needed for improvement of their company services, because it varies for each company. However it does encourage me not to be so consumed with my phone because the more I am on it, the more these corporations know about me and my personal life I don’t want people knowing.

# Blog Week 3
Whenever I first starting working on the html self portrait project I was a little frustrated about how little I knew about it and how complicated it all seemed. However thanks to some friends and google I was able to gain more knowledge over time about how to do some of the things I wanted to do. It took me about three hours to do the entire project including the finding the pictures, putting them into the folder, cropping their size, putting their size and coordinates into html, then doing some final edits. In the end I actually enjoyed learning about html and how some of it works, and I was happy about the finished product. 
To start off my project, most people were downloading the brackets app so I also thought this would be the best move for me. After I downloaded brackets it all started getting very confusing to me because I have never worked with or rarely even seen code. So quite frankly, I was a little discouraged and confused when I opened the app up. My peers helped explain the app to me a little, but in the end I simply had to do my own research. I found that it wasn’t as complicated as I thought, I was just going to have to do a little research on which commands do what. I then realized that I had to come up with an idea for my project. After thinking about it I decided I was going to make a bunch of tiny pictures of my favorite movies and put them into “BK” letters (which are my initials). I then put all the movie pictures into the folder and began to plug those into the html code so they would appear on the web page, next came the hardest part.
My next move was to find out how to put the pictures where I wanted them, so I googled some things. I found a code where it gave me a “top” command and a “left” or “right” command. After those words I would put the number of pixels from the word I used I wanted to place it. Doing the math on this was a little difficult but I got it done in a little over an hour of diligent work. Once I got my “BK” done with all my movie pictures I wanted to try and make it interactive and put the hover command on so when I moved my mouse on the picture it would enlarge. If I am being honest I tried and tried to do this but I could not find a code that worked, obviously I was doing something wrong but I had no idea what and neither did my peers. I changed the background color to make the pictures a little more visible. As previously stated, I ended up enjoying working with html and thought my finished product was great. 

# Blog-week-1
The readings this week brought to light something I hadn’t thought much about which was the effects and power technology has on a society. The first reading about telegraphs by J Carey talked about the changes the simple telegraph made to society forever. Instead of people having to physically travel to pass news to someone else far away they could now send it through the telegraph without having to move to the person. This wasn’t just a luxury used by people who didn’t feel like taking messages to others but also in things like war. Messages could be sent quick and easy to give a side an advantage of quick communication over their enemy. The first article pointed out the massive changes the telegraph brought to the world. Tim Wu then tries to illustrate how the internet can change society but mostly how easily it can be controlled by a government. When one talks about the internet the first thing that comes up usually is computers, and how they are the hub that allows everybody, even the unprofessional to access all sorts of information in seconds. Some believe computers are not educational or as effective as the classic classroom but others believe they will. Since this was written computers have developed so much more and are a part of most all schools and some people get their education completely from their computer. The article then goes on to talk about on page 322 how the simpler the device is the more the human mind is prone to remember how to work it and therefore it will be more successful. For me, I gravitate towards the more simple product when it comes to electronics. People have come up to me with facts as to why the Android is technically a better phone than the Iphone, but I know that the Iphone is simple and easy to work so I stick with it. You could make the assumption that this is why apple does better than most all other electronic companies they compete with across all their products because it is simple and easy to use. Obviously simplicity is only one of the many reasons why Apple dominates their competitors but it is an important one. People like simple because they are already dealing with problems of their own and don’t want an extra one with their computer.
